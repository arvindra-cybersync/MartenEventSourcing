# MartenEventSourcing
This project demonstrates a **production-grade Event Sourcing system** built with **.NET 8**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Marten**.   It follows **Clean Architecture** and **SOLID** principles, using Marten to handle event storage, projections, and document persistence on top of PostgreSQL.
